Concrete compressive strength and income exceeds 50k$/yr and MPG and hepatitis prediction using machine learning
Completed this project as part of my  Advance Data Science  with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

	Studied and Analyzed the Concrete compressive strength and income exceeds 50k$/yr and MPG and hepatitis Prediction datasets to applying ML models and present my insights.

	Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.

	Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression,Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting,SQL.

	Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
